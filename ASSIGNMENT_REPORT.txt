- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

#### 3.1.3 Version and Dependencies
```
selenium==4.15.2
webdriver-manager==4.0.1
```

### 3.2 Tool 2: Cucumber/Behave

#### 3.2.1 Overview
Cucumber (implemented as Behave in Python) is a BDD framework that allows writing test cases in natural language using Gherkin syntax.

#### 3.2.2 Key Features

```

---

## 4. Tool Basics and Implementation

### 4.1 Selenium WebDriver Implementation

#### 4.1.1 Driver Setup
The WebDriver setup includes Chrome browser configuration with headless mode for automated testing:

```python
class DriverSetup:
    def setup_driver(self):
        chrome_options = Options()
        chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
        chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
        chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
        
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
        self.driver.implicitly_wait(10)
        return self.driver
```

#### 4.1.2 Element Interaction Methods
- **Element Finding:** By class name, ID, text content
- **User Actions:** Click, type, navigate, wait
- **Verification:** Assertions, element state checks
- **Error Handling:** Timeouts, exception management

#### 4.1.3 Browser Management
- Automatic driver initialization
- Page navigation and loading
- Screenshot capture for debugging
- Resource cleanup after test completion

### 4.2 Cucumber/Behave Implementation

#### 4.2.1 Feature File Structure
Feature files use Gherkin syntax for readable test scenarios:

```gherkin
Feature: Add to Cart
  As a customer
  I want to add products to my shopping cart
  So that I can purchase multiple items

  Scenario: Add one product to cart
    Given the user is on the e-kart homepage
    And the cart is empty
    When the user clicks "Add to Cart" for one product
    Then the cart should display that product
    And the cart should contain 1 product
    And the total price should be correctly updated
```

#### 4.2.2 Step Definition Mapping
Step definitions connect Gherkin scenarios to Selenium actions:

```python
@given('the user is on the e-kart homepage')
def step_user_on_homepage(context):
    WebDriverWait(context.driver, 10).until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "products-grid"))
    )
    assert "Mini E-Kart" in context.driver.title
```
